# Product Philosophy & Principles

While we use vision and strategy to guide what we work on, there are some common principles that define our behavior in building our product: 

- **Product Direction not Roadmap**: We work in an agile development process. We think of roadmapping and product development as living; subject to changes as our communities and customer needs change. 

- **Collaborative Product Design**: We welcome input from all members of the core staff and community. This helps us uncover blind spots and ensures we adhere to our [leadership principles](https://handbook.mattermost.com/company/about-mattermost#leadership-principles).

- **MVP and Iteration**: We use data in our decision making processes. By developing an MVP (minimum viable product) of a solution, we can gather more data to inform our future work; thereby allowing us to create solutions for real pains and not assumed pains. A MVP may include providing a prototype or a partial solution so we can collect feedback in the most realistic scenarios . 

- **Quality is a first class citizen**: At Mattermost, one of our values is to “Insist on high standards”. This means we keep a high quality bar for our product. [Each release we follow a thorough testing process that ensures each feature meets our [design principles](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/fx-guidelines.html), is tested for ________________. -- maybe add info on dot releases etc, or link to another part of our release process docs??]  If a solution does not meet this bar, we will push a feature into a later release instead of risking creating issues and frustrating our customers.
