# Launch Plan

A launch planâ€™s goal is to drive awareness in the market so that those who are not customers can get some exposure to our product and our offerings. It is different than a release plan or a roadmap in that in a launch we highlight the most exciting changes to our product. A launch plan is owned by the marketing team whereas the release plan is owned by the release team (R&D). 

We may plan a launch with the release of a new product offering or at the release of a highly demanded feature. The timing of a launch may be different than a release depending on other communications and events of the organization.  

You can find Launch Plans here (// XXX TODO).
