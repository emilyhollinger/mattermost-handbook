# Voice, Tone and Writing Style Guidelines

Below is a start of voice, tone and writing style guidelines for public web properties. This is a work in progress, to be iterated on. Some of the content in this document is borrowed from the [Mattermost Editorial Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWjtWdF77qKdxDso_-aC_S1c3E0ohOoxCRL_PIf3pco/edit#), which is managed by the Marketing team. 

Some of the recommendations across the documents, such as punctuating lists and heading capitalization are not currently aligned but will be iterated on for alignment across all web properties. 

## Voice and Tone

Our voice is informed by our foundation as a messaging platform for Enterprise Developers and DevOps, but respects that our client base spans many types of organizations. Writing is one way we can bring Mattermost’s values to life. And above all, our voice demonstrates our deep respect for our clients and users. Ultimately, Mattermost exists because of them, so it’s important we keep their needs at the forefront of our writing style.

Mattermost's voice is:
* Professional
* Concise
* Clear
* Consistent
* Customer-centric
* Empowering

To achieve this, we keep the following principles in mind when writing content: 

* Use simple, plain language that is easy to understand
* Use direct, casual tone instead of an informal tone
* Use the active voice
* Write clearly - avoid vague terms and jargon
* Write short, active sentences and maintain a visual separation between page elements

The appropriate tone differs across different mediums. We don’t write help documentation with the same tone as website copy.
You can vary your tone to fit the situation, just as you’d talk to an angry person with a different tone than with an excited child. Voice is to tone as climate is to weather. The Mattermost voice remains the same, even when the tone varies.

## Writing Tenets

* Work on the premise that "Every page is page 1", as a large portion of users enters our documentation from a Google search**
* Add a summary to the top of each page for readers to be able to quickly assess the content for suitability
* Write clearly and concisely - get to the point quickly without losing valuable information
* Focus on what the target audience wants to accomplish by being practical/outcome-focused
* Break long sections into smaller, easily digestable subpages
* Have at most one key point or action per paragraph
* Refer to one thing or idea with the same word throughout the page.
* Use ordered lists or bullets where appropriate, as they are generally easier to read than long blocks of text
* Write for an international audience without idioms or expressions that people outside of your region are unlikely to understand
* Minimize content so it can be found and remembered. Keep pages short, modular, and focused on a single topic.

## Writing Style

**Numbers**

Spell out numbers when the number is the first word in a sentence or is less than or equal to ten, otherwise use numeric digits. Use commas to make long numbers easier to read.

**Capitalization**

Use title case for page titles and section titles.

Title case: Grammar, Spelling, and Mechanics
Sentence case: Language and spelling

## Avoid Fluff

We avoid using the following words and phrases as they're overused and vague:

* Work better
* Do better work, faster
* Get more done in less time
* Chat (as a stand alone feature reference. However it is ok to use chat when describing a benefit "Create a Jira ticket without leaving your chat window" )
* DevOps teams 
* Utilize (instead, use “use”)
* High performance teams
* Phrases that directly praise ourselves: “We’ve built an intuitive workplace messaging solution”, “It’s a joy to use”

## Writing an MVP

When you submit a PR for your contribution, please include documentation with it. The documentation can be submitted as a new file using the following format:

\## Introduction and Context\
*Details of the current feature/function and what the contribution fixes or adds. This can be presented as bullet points.*

\## Configuration (if applicable)\
*Provide configuration and set up steps in the context of the change/feature.*

\## Code Samples (if applicable)\
*Include any code samples that should be included in the user-facing documentation.*

\## Installation Process\
*Include any processes or procedures that users have to perform to enable/use the change/addition.*

\## Troubleshooting/Known Issues (if applicable)\
*Include any known issues or limitations that may affect how the feature/process works.*

We don't expect a huge body of documentation or that it's perfectly-written - but rather a clear, concise outline of the change which can be added to our documentation. 

During the editorial review, editors may make punctuation and/or terminology changes and commit them to save time on the review process. This only applies to punctuation/terminology - any content suggestions and questions will follow the usual review and discussion process.

Once the editorial review is complete, we'll move your documentation contribution to the appropriate part of the guide (if it's not there already). We'll share the URL and you can edit it at any time if you need to.

These guidelines were inspired by [Stripe's knowledge base content](https://document360.io/blog/tear-down-of-stripe-knowledge-base/), which is widely perceived as excellent by the developer community, and [by other sites shared in this Document360 article](https://document360.io/blog/10-knowledge-base-software-best-practice-examples/).
