# Writing an MVP

When you submit a PR for your contribution, please include documentation with it. The documentation can be submitted as a new file and you can use the example below for content and structural guidance:

```
## Introduction and Context
*Details of the current feature/function and what the contribution fixes or adds. This can be presented as bullet points.*

## Configuration (if applicable)
*Provide configuration and set up steps in the context of the change/feature.*

## Code Samples (if applicable)
*Include any code samples that should be included in the user-facing documentation.*

## Installation Process
*Include any processes or procedures that users have to perform to enable/use the change/addition.*

## Troubleshooting/Known Issues (if applicable)
*Include any known issues or limitations that may affect how the feature/process works.*
```

We don't expect a huge body of documentation or that it's perfectly-written - but rather a clear, concise outline of the change which can be added to our documentation. 

During the editorial review, editors may make punctuation and/or terminology changes and commit them to save time on the review process. This only applies to punctuation/terminology - content suggestions and questions will follow the usual review and discussion process.

Once the editorial review is complete, we'll move your documentation contribution to the appropriate part of the guide (if it's not there already). We'll share the URL and you can edit it at any time if you need to.
